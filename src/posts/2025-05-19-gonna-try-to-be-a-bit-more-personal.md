I like this blog. I do. It may not seem like it, given the paltry updates.

I realized recently that's because of the criteria I had for myself for years - that I would keep this blog focused on web development. That's because of who I thought "my audience" was.

That has held me back. The real reason I don't post for ... months ... sometimes, is that I just don't feel like I have anything to say when it comes to web development. It could be that I've been heads down in work, but nothing that has happened in that work is worth sharing.

I'm a more complete person than that. I have lots of things I could talk about, and they don't necessarily have to do with web development or engineering management.

I forgot who the most important audience was - myself. I have to be happy with this blog first.

I'm into running, sketching, painting, magic, and pizza making. I read a lot. I feel like I have stuff to share about all of those things, and this is a great place to do it. It's my blog, dammit, and I'm gonna write about what I want to write about.

Will it still heavily skew towards web development? Absolutely. But this is me giving myself permission to write about whatever I want to write about.
