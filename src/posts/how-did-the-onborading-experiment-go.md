As I [mentioned previously](/ideas-for-an-onboarding-checklist/) - we had a new team member join recently, and I wrote an extensive onboarding checklist that tried to capture every little thing they needed to get operational.

So, how did it go?

**Very well!**

After two days, they had access to all of our systems, was in all the right Slack rooms, and had cloned the repos for our major applications. _And_ had those applications up and running locally - which is no small feat.

By the end of the third day, they had filed their first pull request.

By the end of the week (it was a four day week due to a holiday) **they had done their first production push!**

In my book, this was an _unqualified success_.

Oh, and because of the checklist, even in those first two days they needed a small amount of face time with me. When you have a new hire, as a manager, bringing on a new person can mean a lot of time directly communicating with them and helping them figure out stuff. The checklist got them going - and they were able to do most of it _on their own_.
