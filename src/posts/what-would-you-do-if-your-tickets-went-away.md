You've been working somewhere for a while. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of tickets, tasks, etc, that have built up over the years. You have a backlog that you don't ever hope to see the bottom of.

What if that all went away? No backups. No screenshots. And for the sake of argument, the system you were using is no longer an option in any way.

What would you do?

Personally I find the idea intoxicatingly liberating. I know there are a lot of people who would find it appalling.

How would you assess what work is in process? What would you do to capture the work that you *remember off hand* still needs to be done? What systems would you adopt? How would you define your work?

I have a colleague who has talked about this fantasy before. Their contention is - yeah, we'd loose the backlog, but anything that is _truly_ important would come back up.

I liken this to your house burning down. Yeah, you'll be sad to loose all your stuff. But it would be an unbelievable chance to start from scratch, and only accumulate stuff that truly matters.

I do find thinking through these kinds of worst-case-scenarios oddly comforting. If I can envision a way forward even in extreme circumstances, I think that I'm overall a more reslient leader.
