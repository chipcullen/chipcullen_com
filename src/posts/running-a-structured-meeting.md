I've led a lot of meetings over the years. To do this well is a practiced skill that you need to be intentional about. Good meetings don't just happen.

I was fortunate during an early phase of my career to work at a consulting firm that specialized in running large meetings. Their clients were high level government officials, so these large meetings had to make use of everyone's time effectively. The folks in those rooms were _not_ the kind of people who tolerated wasting time.

What I'm sharing here are the barest essentials that I picked up from that experience. These are useful ideas that will improve any meeting that you need to organize that is more than an informal discussion.

## Prepare to prepare

The fact of the matter is that getting ready to hold a truly effective meeting takes time. More time than you'd expect.

For major meetings, the rule of thumb I was taught was **for every hour of meeting time, it's at least three hours of prep time**.

Now, that was true for major, all-day affairs with dozens or hundreds of people. You may find yourself not needing to spend quite that much time getting a meeting ready, but know that there is a spectrum of preparedness that you're on.

While at first blush these might seem like a major time suck for you (and it is) - keep in mind that you will be making _infinitely much better use_ of the time for everyone _in_ that meeting. The more high up the attendees of your meeting, the more you should be sweating the prep.

Also, a truly well prepared and run meeting will get everyone to an objective _faster_. Organizationally it's a real speed bump. If you finally manage to get all of the right people in the room, it's amazing how quickly real decisions can be made.

## Communicate Outcomes and and Agenda

When sending out the original meeting invitation, there are two key elements to communicate: the *outcomes* that are being saught, and the *agenda* for the time in the meeting.

### What do you mean by outcomes?

A simple, brief statement on the goal of the meeting. _What_ are you hoping to accomplish? If you can't articulate this, then you probably shouldn't be holding a meeting.

Bad example of an outcome statement:

> Let's brainstorm on what's needed for our app

Good examples of an outcome statement:

> Outcome: A shared understanding of the major pieces of work needed to build the new version of our user-facing application, and an initial idea of who will be responsible for which pieces of work.

While it's lengthier - it's much more clear and specific. This will set clear expectations of anyone involved as to what will happen during the meeting. Coincidentally it
