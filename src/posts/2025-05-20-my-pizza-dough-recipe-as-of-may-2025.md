Everyone needed a COVID hobby. Mine was learning how to make pizza at home. We typically have "Pizza Friday" 2-3 times a month - so, I've made quite a few pizzas in the last few years.

What I'm sharing here is the recipe for pizza dough that I use for my family. It's the third major version, but I've been using it for at least a year and a half. My aim is to make a "New York-ish" style pizza.
