Everyone needed a COVID hobby. Mine was learning how to make pizza at home. We typically have "Pizza Friday" 2-3 times a month - so, I've made quite a few pizzas in the last few years.

What I'm sharing here is the recipe for pizza dough that I use for my family. It's the third major version, but I've been using it for at least a year and a half. My aim is to make a "New York-ish" style pizza.

And - even better - [**here is the recipe as a Google Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G79fdCg0Gz0eWTO8lOLhEhoHNiIW3ZCS4pD8JSqgFUU/edit?usp=sharing)! This will allow you to choose different numbers & sizes of pizzas, and it adjusts the ingredients accordingly.

Full credit - this recipe started life as [Roberta's Pizza Dough](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016230-robertas-pizza-dough) from the NY Times. I've tweaked it a bit over the years.

## Equipment

*   Food scale
    
*   Instant read thermometer - probe or IR gun style work
    
*   Stand mixer
