I've found a tool that has really helped facilitate technical problem sovling discussions. It's a tool that keeps the conversation on track, and avoids long drawn out re-hashing of the same solutions and objections.

**The humble Pro's / Con's list.**

| Pro's | Con's |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Something good    |  Something bad   |

## The problem

I work with a lot of smart people. They bring a lot of perspectives and experience levels to the table when we have meetings to discuss technical problems.

When we have large meetings, I have noticed that some conversations tend to chase their own tail, given enough time. That's because while debating the merits of solutions to issues, those same smart people think of lots of objections to a given proposal.

One might even say engineers _like_ to poke holes in ideas. But you didn't hear me say that. ðŸ˜‰

## Every solution has a drawback

Given even a moderately complicated problem, every solution will have some kind of drawback.

The severity of the drawback is in the eye of the beholder. Ever try raising the objection of too many http requests to an executive?

But here's the thing - if you're talking to a group of smart people, those people will likely put an inordinate amount of severity on the objection that they present.

When leading a discussion, how can you capture those objections in such a way that they can be considered rationally?

## Enter: the Pro's / Con's list

During technical meetings where we are trying to solve problems - think project planning meetings, troubleshooting meetings etc - I like to have a written document in front of everyone that I update in real time.

I use a Google Doc, but you can use whatever tool you want. That could be Microsoft Word, Notion, etc. Heck, you could even use another one of my favorite tools - [a spreadsheet](/spreadsheets-as-a-development-tool/).

If using a Doc, I insert a table [get command here] that is 2 columns wide, and start with maybe 5 rows. I'll put a header with a proposed solution above it, and as Pro's or Con's are brought up by the group, I will write them down.

## How does this help?

First, it makes sure that every pro and every con is heard, and that people in the discussion feel heard. Their concerns are not being overlooked.
